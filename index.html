        <p>
        I have been a law enforcement professional for 15 years. I later achieved a role serving as an accident reconstructionist,
        which entails analyzing roadway evidence and applying principales of physics to determine the speeds and trajectory
        of the involved vehicles and/or beings. I have also been serving as a detective for the past 4 years. During my time in 
        law enforcement, I have investigated more than 500 motor vehicle collisions and over 1,000 criminal investigations, 
        made over 400 arrests, and executed 70 search warrants.
